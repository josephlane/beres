<hr />

Beres is an online application that provides the best resources available for a given topic.

This idea came about as a result of studying computer science fundalmentals and having to visit 
numerous websites before I found one worth while. I figured there had to be a portal or website 
of some sort that you could visit to save time--to my suprise, I couldn't find antyhing. 

Beres utilizes the community to vote on resources they feel are the most relevant.

You can visit this application at https://beres-online.herokuapp.com/beres/
